# Arduino Autonomous Car

An autonomous self-driving car with lane detection and collision avoidance.
<br/></br>
## Features
- **Lane Detection**
> The car tracks the lane line of the road and manoeuvres accordingly to stay in the lane.

- **Collision Avoidance**
> When an obstacle lies in the car's path, it analyses the object's size to go around/overtake it and gets back on the desired lane. This is independent of the object's size as long as at least one open pathway exists.

- **Bluetooth Enabled**
> Optional BT feature to control the car as an RC car using a [mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller)
